# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 problem solving algorithms in hackerrank.

**Thoughts:** Hmm, I just started learning python 3 weeks ago. I am able to do some algorithms in hackerrank. I am not able to do complicated ones. May be I should get a good grip of basics by doing python practise instead.
